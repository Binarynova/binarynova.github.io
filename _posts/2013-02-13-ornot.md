Well Wordpress lasted a whole day before it started giving me fits. So I changed my mind, now I'm going with self-hosted and hand-written code. We'll see how this goes. :)

There is still a lot of work to do here, so if the site looks simple with plain colored boxes everywhere that's because I'm not finished yet. Work-in-progress and all that. :)
