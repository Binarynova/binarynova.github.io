My main personal website and blog is back up and running after a short hiatus while I figured out what I wanted to do. I decided to go back to using WordPress for its simplicity. If I have to I can add some plugins to support images and video in the future, or I can use some other software provided by my web host to do that stuff.

Eventually I really want to break my content away from corporate sites like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, so I'll be using this website to do that.
