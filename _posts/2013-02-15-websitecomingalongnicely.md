<p>Well for the most part the underlying and behind-the-scenes structure of the website is finished. There are a few other tweaks that will be added in the future like having pages dedicated to showing all posts in a given category (like showing all Link posts or all Video posts). But as of right now it's functioning. And it's pretty cool. I just write up a small post and Jekyll does the rest of the work. It inserts it into my page's layout, makes all the appropriate links, and even adds it to an RSS feed. Very nice. :) Then <a href="http://www.ifttt.com" target="_blank">IFTTT.com</a> reads my RSS feed, notices there's a new post, and sends it to Facebook. Done and done. :D</p>
