title: More Guides Complete
---
Secret of Mana (Any% Glitched) guide complete and added to the speedrun guide page!

Despite difficulties near the end of the game, my Final Fantasy III Any% Glitchless guide is also complete! I split it into three parts since it's rather image heavy and I want the guide to be pretty repsonsive and smooth in any browser. There's still a bit that can be done to clean it up, but as of right now it can be used to get through the game!
